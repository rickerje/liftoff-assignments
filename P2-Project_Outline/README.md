# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
According to the Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA), 200 million Americans say they want to write a book. That’s about two-thirds of the population. How many of them actually do that? Considering that 129 million books have been published, ever, the answer is: not many. It’s hard to know how to do it if you don’t know where to start. It’s easier if you have a plan… an outline.
 
Outliner is a Web-based app for users to outline plot-centered novels in an accessible question-and-answer format. Once they have created an account, users are able to log in and create multiple outlines for novels, building them by answering a series of questions that guide them through the process. They can save their progress at any time and come back to complete their outline, revise, or save or delete it. When complete (or at any time during the process), they can output their outline by printing, sending via email, saving as a PDF or saving to their Google docs.
 
For writers of fiction, the outline is a sometimes contentious step in the process. Some writers bypass it entirely—they’re known as pantsers, as in they “fly by the seat of their pants.” Others, known as plotters, meticulously outline each step of their story’s progression and only start writing when the outline is complete. Outliner offers benefit to both groups. The plotter will find it an easy, intuitive way to create what they’ve always been doing. Pantsers will find it useful when they get stuck, when they’ve finished a manuscript and need a roadmap for revision. Both groups will find it helpful when a prospective agent requests an outline of the work they’re submitting for consideration.

### Technologies
* Programming language: C# or Java (do not currently know Java)
  * If C#: ASP .NET MVC
  * If Java: whatever passes for an MVC framework in that language
* HTML and CSS
* Bootstrap


### What I'll Have to Learn
* Java, if I decide to code this in a language I can code in natively in the macOS, without having to run the (sluggish and memory-intensive) Windows virtual machine
* Java’s MVC framework
* How to interface with Google’s API so people can export their outlines to Google docs
