# Project Outline
### Overview
According to the Independent Book Publishers Association (IBPA), 200 million Americans say they want to write a book. That’s about two-thirds of the population. How many of them actually do that? Considering that 129 million books have been published, ever, the answer is: not many. It’s hard to know how to do it if you don’t know where to start. It’s easier if you have a plan… an outline.
 
Outliner is a Web-based app for users to outline plot-centered novels in an accessible question-and-answer format. Once they have created an account, users are able to log in and create multiple outlines for novels, building them by answering a series of questions that guide them through the process. They can save their progress at any time and come back to complete their outline, revise, or save or delete it. When complete (or at any time during the process), they can output their outline by printing, sending via email, saving as a PDF or saving to their Google docs.
 
For writers of fiction, the outline is a sometimes contentious step in the process. Some writers bypass it entirely—they’re known as pantsers, as in they “fly by the seat of their pants.” Others, known as plotters, meticulously outline each step of their story’s progression and only start writing when the outline is complete. Outliner provides benefits to both groups. For the plotter it offers an easy, intuitive way to create what they’ve always been doing. Pantsers find it useful when they get stuck, when they’ve finished a manuscript and need a roadmap for revision. For both groups, Outliner is helpful when a prospective agent requests an outline of the work they’re submitting for consideration.

### Features
* User login: Give users the ability to create an account and log in
  * Give the option to use their Google account? Probably requires an API
  * What about admin level? Who can you ask for help?
* Create Outlines: Create and save multiple outline projects
* Modify Outlines: Give the option to start from the beginning or pick up where the user left off in prior session
* Output: Allow users to export/save in multiple options:
  * Print
  * Email to user
  * Save to Google docs
  * Save as PDF
* Help: At each stage, give users “?” icons they can click to find out more about this part of the outline, what it is, how it works, and why it’s important.
* (Bonus) Paid/Pro: What if there’s a paid option? Payment integration?

### Technologies
* Programming language: C#
* ASP .NET MVC
* HTML and CSS
* Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
* How to interface with Google’s API so people can export their outlines to Google docs
* I will need to step up my CSS skills to make this look more customized and less like out-of-the-box.
* I'll want their output to be clean and easy to use and/or modify, so I'll need to learn how to export the outline information from the database into a clean, formatted document for Word / PDF.
* (Bonus) Integration with payment platform (Paypal/Stripe/Gumroad/etc.)
